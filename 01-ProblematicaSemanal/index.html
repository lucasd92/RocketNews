            <p>
                At Google's <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/pixel-5-chromecast-google-tv-nest-audio-everything-google-just-announced/">Launch Night</a>  
                In event Wednesday, the internet giant unveiled its latest Pixel phones, the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/pixel-5-unveiled-google-officially-joins-5g-game-with-new-flagship-phone/">Pixel 5</a>  
                and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-reveals-its-499-pixel-4a-5g-but-a-us-release-isnt-coming-until-november/">Pixel 4A 5G</a> 
                , following the August launch of the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-pixel-4a-349-dollars-budget-phone-for-you-review/">Pixel 4A</a> . The Pixel 5 is Google's main flagship phone and is the 
                follow-up to last year's <a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/google-pixel-4-review-great-camera-astrophotography-high-price-battery-life-review/">Pixel 4</a> . The Pixel 4A 5G, meanwhile, serves as a slightly bumped-up version of the Pixel
                4A, which is part of Google's midrange line of phones. The Pixel 5 costs $699 (£599, AU$999) and the Pixel 4A 5G
                is $499 (£499, AU$799), with preorders live now.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Google's marquee handset, the Pixel 5 is the most premium and advanced of all phones. It features 5G 
                connectivity, a 90Hz display and reverse wireless charging. Compared to its predecessor, it's $100 cheaper at
                launch and it makes big jumps in battery capacity and memory. But, it now struts an ultrawide camera (in 
                lieu of the Pixel 4's telephoto camera), and it doesn't have Google's Soli motion sensing or facial 
                recognition technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Pixel 4A 5G also has 5G, but it doesn't have a higher refresh rate screen and it can't charge other
                accessories. It's also not water resistant, unlike the Pixel 5. It does, however, have a headphone jack 
                similar to the Pixel 4A.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the US, the Pixel 5 will be available from retailers on Oct. 29 and you can find the Pixel 4A 5G on 
                shelves Nov. 19. The Pixel 4A is already available through online retailers and carriers.
